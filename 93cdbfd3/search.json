    "text": "What is Quarto\nQuarto is an additional program designed to compliment R. It uses R’s markdown feature, which allows you to create documents, such as journal articles, while integrating charts/graphs directly from R. Quarto takes this a step further and allows you to write books, websites, and other documents using R. This means that scholars who are familiar with the R language can create their own custom websites.\n\n\nThis Site\nThis files for this site are available on my Github for all to see. When you view the .qmd files, you can see exactly what I have to type in order to program this website. In future posts, I hope to create easy to follow tutorials, so that I can help academics make personal websites and blogs just like this one!"

    "text": "Veterans and Suicidality\nI want to draw from one article discussing how Veterans Administration researchers used Machine Learning (ML) to save lives. In this article, researchers used over 61 variables and an actual data set of veterans to predict which veterans would be a potential high-suicide risk reliably. This model was tested at a VA Healthcare System."

    "text": "Machine Learning Beats Clinicians\nThis model predicted veterans who were 30~60 times more likely to engage in suicidal behaviors than others in a sample. Within this sample, clinicians could only identify 30% of veterans that the ML model predicted would be a risk. ML can miss the often hidden warning signs of suicide because it knows where to look."

I’ve also used R for non-data purposes, such as developing this website with R markdown.\nPython : I use Python for some data tasks but primarily for automation and writing other scripts. When necessary, I can use the everyday data science libraries that are made for the Python language.\nLinux: I operate my Home Lab server, which has given me the basic knowledge of maintaining and setting up Linux servers using the command line. This includes implementing security measures to prevent data from being compromised and protecting against other common cyber-attacks."
