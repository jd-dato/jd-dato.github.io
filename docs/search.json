I can use R markdown to take a large data set and turn it into a pleasing graph anywhere you’d like, and quickly.\n\n\n\nWhat I am currently learning:\n\nR\n\nPython is a great language for data analysis. But in niche scenarios, it is more likely to find packages and resources for the R language. That’s why I think it is important that I strive for mastery in R, so I can be prepared for any situation.\n\nSQL\n\nSQL is essential to database management. Being able to manage and interact with databases is essential to data analysis, but also to other areas, such as managing a website or app."
