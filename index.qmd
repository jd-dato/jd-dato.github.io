J.D. Dato is an undergraduate Psychology student interested in Psychological Data Science and Data Visualization.

# Education

**University of South Florida**| B.A. Psychology    
Aug 2021 - Present

# Skills

* **R** : I am very comfortable using R to perform data analysis, create visualizations, and for other purposes. This website, for example, was created using R Markdown, a document creation tool. See the "My Work" section to see projects I have made using R.
* **Python 3** : I have intermediate experience using the third version of the Python language.
  + MatPlotLib: I can use this common Python package to plot data quickly from large data sets
  + PANDAS: I can use this python to create tables and clean data
* **Linux**: I operate my own home-lab server which has given me basic knowledge of how to maintain and set-up Linux servers using the command line.



# What I am currently learning:

Rayshader
: Rayshader is a library for R that allows the creation of 3D Data-Visualizaitons. These kinds of visualizations are important because they are the most eye-catching, in my opinion.

SQL
: SQL is essential to database management. Being able to manage and interact with databases is essential to data analysis, but also to other areas, such as managing a website or app.
