J.D. Dato is an undergraduate Psychology student interested in Psychological Data Science and Data Visualization.

# Education

**University of South Florida**| B.A. Psychology    
Aug 2020 - Present

# Skills

* Python 3: I have intermediate experience using the third version of the Python language.
  + MatPlotLib: I can use this common Python package to plot data quickly from large data sets
  + PANDAS: I can use this python to create tables and clean data
* Linux: I operate my own home-lab server which has given me basic knowledge of how to maintain and set-up Linux servers using the command line.
* R Markdown/Quarto: Sometimes you need to display data in a document, book, or even a website like this one. I can use R markdown to take a large data set and turn it into a pleasing graph anywhere you'd like, and quickly.


# What I am currently learning:

Rayshader
: Rayshader is a library for R that allows the creation of 3D Data-Visualizaitons. These kinds of visualizations are important because they are the most eye-catching, in my opinion.

SQL
: SQL is essential to database management. Being able to manage and interact with databases is essential to data analysis, but also to other areas, such as managing a website or app.
