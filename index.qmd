J.D. Dato is an undergraduate Psychology student interested in Psychological Data Science and Data Visualization.

# Education

**University of South Florida**| B.A. Psychology   
Aug 2021 - Present

# Skills

* **R** : I am very comfortable using R to analyze data, create visualizations, and other purposes. This website, for example, was created using R Markdown, a document creation tool based on R. See the "My Work" section to see projects I have made using R.
* **Python 3** : I am familiar with using Python to create meaningful visualizations, fundamental data analysis, and for scripting/automation. I am also learning how to use Sci-Kit Learn for machine learning.
* **Linux**: I operate my own home-lab server which has given me basic knowledge of how to maintain and set-up Linux servers using the command line. This includes implementing measures to protect the data on my server from outside attacks.



# What I am currently learning:

Rayshader
: [Rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com) is a library for R that allows the creation of 3D Data-Visualizaitons. These kinds of visualizations are important because they are the most eye-catching, in my opinion.
