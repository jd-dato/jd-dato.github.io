## Education

**University of South Florida**| B.A. Psychology

## Technical Skills

* **R** : I am comfortable using R to transform, visualize, and model data. I've also used R for non-data purposes, such as developing this website with R markdown.
* **Python** : I use Python for some data tasks but primarily for automation and writing other scripts. When necessary, I can use the everyday *data science* libraries that are made for the Python language.
* **Linux**: I operate my Home Lab server, which has given me the basic knowledge of maintaining and setting up Linux servers using the command line.



## What I am currently learning:



Flask
: [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/) is a Python microframework for developing web applicaitons. I am currently learning how to use Flask to develop a membership management system for a non-profit organization.
