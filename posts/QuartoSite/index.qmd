# What is R?

R is quickly becoming the go to programming language for Data Analysis.

# What is Quarto
Quarto is an additional program designed to compliment R. It uses R's markdown feature, which allows you to create documents, such as journal articles, while integrating charts/graphs directly from R. Quarto takes this a step further and allows you to write books, websites, and other documents using R. This means that scholars who are familiar with the R language can create their own custom websitesR.

# This Site

In future posts, I hope to create easy to follow tutorials, so that I can help academics make personal websites and blogs just like this one!
