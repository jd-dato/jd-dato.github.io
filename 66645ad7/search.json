    "text": "What is Quarto\nQuarto is an additional program designed to compliment R. It uses R’s markdown feature, which allows you to create documents, such as journal articles, while integrating charts/graphs directly from R. Quarto takes this a step further and allows you to write books, websites, and other documents using R. This means that scholars who are familiar with the R language can create their own custom websitesR.\n\n\nThis Site\nThis files for this site are available on my Github for all to see. When you view the .qmd files, you can see exactly what I have to type in order to program this website. In future posts, I hope to create easy to follow tutorials, so that I can help academics make personal websites and blogs just like this one!"

These kinds of visualizations are important because they are the most eye-catching, in my opinion.\n\nSQL\n\nSQL is essential to database management. Being able to manage and interact with databases is essential to data analysis, but also to other areas, such as managing a website or app."
